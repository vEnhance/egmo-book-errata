This book lists all the errata for my textbook
[Euclidean Geometry in Math Olympiads](https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html).

## Submitting more errata

If you find more errata, you can have it added to this list by
**submitting a pull request** on GitHub.
Since you are probably only making small changes,
then you can use the GitHub website itself to live-edit the files.

The steps to create a new pull request are as follows:

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and login to it,
   if you already haven't.
2. Go to [main.tex](https://github.com/vEnhance/egmo-book-errata/blob/main/main.tex)
   and press the pencil icon.
3. Edit your changes using the website's editor, and press "Propose changes".
4. Press the green "Create pull request" button.
5. In the resulting form, write a title and description if you want, then
   click "create pull request" again.
